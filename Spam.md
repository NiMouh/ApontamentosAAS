## Numerical stability
Numerical instability is a concept that refers to the propensity of an algorithm or computational procedure to produce inaccurate results due to round-off errors, truncation errors, or other computational issues.

## NLTK
NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.

**Tokenization** is the process of tokenizing or splitting a string, text into a list of tokens.

**Lemmatization** is the process of grouping together the different inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single item.

**Stemming** is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root form.

## Text-mining
Text mining is the process of deriving high-quality information from text.

### Term Frequency
Term frequency is the measurement of how frequently a term occurs within a document.

### Data visualization
There are two traditional visualizations for textual data:
- Bar plots (for frequency and ranking)
- WordClouds: are graphical representations of word frequency that give greater prominence to words that appear more frequently in a source text. The larger the word in the visual the more common the word was in the document(s).

### TF-IDF
TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) is a statistical measure that evaluates how relevant a word is to a document in a collection of documents.

This is done by multiplying two metrics: how many times a word appears in a document, and the inverse document frequency of the word across a set of documents.

### Blind Optimization
Blind optimization is the process of finding the best solution to a problem without having any idea of how good that solution is.

Examples of blind optimization algorithms are:
- Genetic Evolution
- Differential Evolution
- Particle Swarm Optimization: is best used to find the maximum or minimum of a function defined on a multidimensional vector space.

### Gradient Descent
A very simple and powerfull algorithm that is used to find a local minimum of a function.

### Logistic Regression
Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn't vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables. It's good for binary classification.

### Classification
There are perhaps three main types of classification tasks that you may encounter; they are:
- **Binary Classification**: those classification tasks that have two class labels (i.e. spam or not spam).
- **Multi-Class Classification**: those classification tasks that have more than two class labels (i.e. what type of spam?)
- **Multi-Label Classification**: those classification tasks that have two or more class labels, where one or more class labels may be predicted for each example (i.e. spam and urgent).
