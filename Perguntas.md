# Teste modelo 1

## What are the main phases of the ML process?
1. Data gathering
2. Data Pre-processing
3. Model training
4. Model evaluation
5. Model deploy

## What are the main classes of models explored until now?
Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning.

## In spam detection using the Bag of Words Model, which of the following best describes the process?
It counts the frequency of specific words and constructs a feature vector.

## Which type of clustering algorithm, among density-based, hierarchical, and partitioning, is most suitable for identifying clusters of varying shapes and sizes in a dataset with noisy data points?
Density-based clustering

## When comparing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders for anomaly detection, which statement is true?
PCA is a linear technique, while Autoencoders can capture both linear and nonlinear patterns, making them more versatile for anomaly detection

## Which of the following best describes the "curse of dimensionality" in the context of data analysis and machine learning?
The curse of dimensionality is a term used to describe the difficulties of visualizing and analyzing data in high-dimensional spaces.

## In the context of anomaly detection, what distinguishes a "collective anomaly" from a "point anomaly"?
Point anomalies are rare events that occur in isolation, while collective anomalies are common patterns in the data.

## In the context of identifying cybersecurity attacks using anomaly detection, which type of attack is most likely to be detected?
Attacks that mimic normal network traffic

## When comparing spam detection using embedded models (e.g., Word Embeddings) and the traditional Bag of Words Model, what is a key difference between the two approaches?
Embedded models consider the order of words, while the Bag of Words Model does not.

## Describe the limitations of the BOW (Bag of Words) model, and discuss how the Language model (e.g. FastText) can overcome them.
It has limitations in handling word order, out-of-vocabulary words, semantics, and word morphology. FastText, as a language model, overcomes these limitations by considering subword information, enabling it to better represent and understand text data, making it a more versatile and powerful tool for a wide range of NLP applications.

## What's ML?
The capability of a model to improve its own performance by using previous data and through trial and error

## When performing spam detection as a binary classification task, what are the two primary classes that emails are categorized into?
Spam and ham

## In anomaly detection using autoencoders, what is the primary role of the encoder component?
To perform feature extraction.

## When discussing email SPAM issues, what is the primary purpose of a spam filter?
To detect and filter out unsolicited and potentially harmful or irrelevant emails.

## When comparing clustering algorithms and Autoencoders for anomaly detection, which of the following statements is accurate?
Clustering algorithms and Autoencoders serve distinct purposes, and neither is superior for anomaly detection universally.

## In the context of anomaly detection, when comparing Isolation Forest and One-Class Support Vector Machine (One-Class SVM), which statement is true?
Isolation Forest can efficiently handle high-dimensional data, while One-Class SVM may struggle with high-dimensional feature spaces.

## In the ongoing fight against spam, which of the following is a common technique used to reduce the impact of spam emails and protect recipients?
Using AI and machine learning for content analysis.

## In the context of anomaly detection through clustering, which type of anomaly detection primarily relies on identifying data points that are farthest from the cluster centers?
Point anomaly detection

## In the context of spam detection using a Bayesian spam filter, what is the main principle behind its operation?
It calculates the probability of an email being spam based on word frequencies.

## Describe how an AutoEncoder can be used as an anomaly detection model (with dynamic thresholding).
Using AutoEncoders for anomaly detection with dynamic thresholding has the advantage of capturing complex patterns and features in the data, making it effective in various domains. The dynamic thresholding approach allows for adaptability to change data patterns and anomalies over time, enhancing the model's ability to detect previously unseen anomalies.

## Why is ML considered for Security and Privacy fields?
Given the latest version of the Internet (IoT) the number of entities will increase at such a rate that human-maintained networks are not possible anymore. That is the need for AI/ML to optimize and protect our networks as autonomously as possible.

## In the context of machine learning and model performance, what does bias and variance represent?
Bias measures the model's ability to fit the training data accurately, while variance measures its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
